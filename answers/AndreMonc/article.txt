ABSTRACT
White-sand vegetation (WSV) harbors a unique avifauna within Amazonia, including species with patchy distributions. The history of these species’ populations is likely related to variation in the availability and connectivity among WSV patches though time. By investigat- ing the phylogeographic history of WSV bird species, we aim to better understand the dynamic evolution of forested and open habitats in Amazonia. Here, we perform a phylogeographic analysis of two WSV specialist bird species, a tanager, Tachyphonus phoenicius, and a hummingbird, Polytmus theresiae. We obtained and analyzed sequences of one mitochondrial and one nuclear gene region from 152 indi- viduals. Results indicate that the two species have different histories. Tachyphonus phoenicius split from its Atlantic Forest/Cerrado sister clade at about 11 Ma and includes two divergent lineages, north and south of the Amazon River. Polytmus theresiae split from its Tepuian sister group at about 2.5 Ma and shows no genetic structure within Amazonia. Both lineages of T. phoenicius and P. theresiae show signs of recent population expansion. Although the two WSV species originated at different moments, and show distinct patterns of popula- tion structure, both seem to have expanded their population sizes recently, indicating that availability of white-sand habitats may have been increasing historically and the connectivity among different white-sand patches may have been higher in the recent past.

DESPITE THE APPEARANCE OF AN ENORMOUS HOMOGENEOUS EX- PANSE OF CONTINUOUS FOREST, Amazonia is a heterogeneous mosaic. In addition to the characteristic upland terra firme forests that cover most of the region, Amazonia contains other vegeta- tion types, including forests flooded by white water (varzea) and byblackwater(igapo),montaneforests,bambooandvineforests, and areas of open, non-forest vegetation (Pires & Prance 1985, Tuomisto et al. 1995). There are two main kinds of open vegetation formations: savannas or cerrados, and habitat patches associated with white-sand soils covered by the characteristic white-sand vegetation (WSV).
Discontinuities between forested and non-forested regions in Amazonia have mostly been discussed in a historical context, ever since Haffer’s (1969) first proposal that isolation of forest

patches by open habitats during glacial cycles was a main driver of diversification for forest taxa (Pleistocene Refuge hypothesis). Since then, there has been a lot of debate with little consensus concerning how Pleistocene climatic cycles affected the distribu- tion of the Amazonian forests. Results have suggested either almost no change in forest cover (Colinvaux et al. 2000, Bush et al. 2004, Mayle et al. 2004) or dramatic replacement of forest by open vegetation during glacial periods (Van der Hammen & Hooghiemstra 2000, Haffer & Prance 2001, Anhuf et al. 2006). Even with more data available on Amazonian paleoclimate, the controversy persists. Detailed speleothem records suggest that western Amazonia was more stable and humid, while the east suffered more pronounced cyclical changes in precipitation (Cheng et al. 2013). Contrastingly, the paleoecological and paleogeomorphological record of western Amazonia indicates arid climates, open vegetation, the presence of large Lujanian (~125–0.85 ka) paleomamals in the lowlands, and more frequent

and intense incursion of cold fronts from southern South Amer- ica (Latrubesse & Ramonell 1994, Van der Hammen & Absy 1994, Latrubesse & Rancy 1998, Mayle et al. 2004).
Many studies have discussed the relationship between refugia formation and diversification of Amazonian forest taxa. Follow- ing controversy about the ‘age’ of Amazonian species (Rull 2011), most recent results have shown a constant speciation rate since the Neogene, with no increase during the Pleistocene (Brumfield 2012, d’Horta et al. 2013). Population genetic studies, on the other hand, frequently show recent demographic changes in populations of Amazonian forest species, which could be an indication of changes in the availability of forest cover during the Pleistocene (Ribas et al. 2012, d’Horta et al. 2013, Harvey & Brumfield 2015). A less often discussed subject (but see Oren 1981, Haffer 1993, W€uster et al. 2005, Quijada-Mascaren~as et al. 2007, Bonvicino et al. 2009, Vargas-Ramırez et al. 2010 Capuru- cho et al. 2013) has been how climate oscillations would have affected the biota that currently occupies the open vegetation for- mations, and, most important, how the evolutionary history of these taxa might help in understanding the past interactions among forested and non-forested habitats.
The avifauna of the two main Amazonian open vegetation habitats, savannas and WSV, are distinct in species composition, and while the savanna avifauna shares many species with other biomes, such as the Cerrado and Atlantic forest, most typical WSV bird species occur only within Amazonia (Borges 2004, 2006, Borges et al. 2015). The high habitat specialization of WSV bird communities (Oren 1981, Borges 2004, 2006, 2013, Borges et al. 2015), suggests a connection between the history of the white-sand formations and the evolution of the bird species char- acteristic of this habitat.
Capurucho et al. (2013) studied the phylogeography and genetic variability in Xenopipo atronitens (Aves; Pipridae), a bird species cate- gorized as ‘near-restricted’ to WSV (Borges et al. 2015). This species diverged from its Tepuian sister species (X. uniformis) about 8 mil- lion years ago (Ma), but has little genetic structure throughout Ama- zonia. The northern Amazonian lineage of X. atronitens shows signal of a recent population expansion, and gene flow was recorded across some of the main Amazonian rivers, especially blackwater riv- ers. This pattern contrasts with those recovered for terra firme forest understory birds (Ribas et al. 2012, Sousa-Neves et al. 2013, Fernan- des et al. 2014, Thom & Aleixo 2015), which have genetic breaks strongly associated with the main Amazonian rivers, following the areas of avian endemism (Cracraft 1985). This is surprising consider- ing that terra firme forest covers most of Amazonia, and the WSV patches are naturally fragmented, covering only about 1.6 percent of the Amazon basin (Adeney 2009).
According to Capurucho et al. (2013), increased availability of sandy deposits in Amazonia through the Quaternary and increased permeability of the forest to WSV species during glacial periods explain current patterns of diversity in X. atronitens. To test the generality of this model, and thus whether it reflects the environmental history of Amazonia and is not merely an idiosyn- cratic pattern characteristic of X. atronitens alone, more WSV restricted or near-restricted species should be studied.
Here, we perform phylogeographic and population genetic analyses of two additional bird species classified as near-restricted to WSV: Tachyphonus phoenicius (Red-shouldered tanager, Thraupi- dae) and Polytmus theresiae (Green-tailed goldenthroat, Trochilidae). These species were chosen because they belong to unrelated bird families and have different behavior compared to X. atronitens, making all three taxa a good test for historical congruence that would indicate common responses to environmental change. Understanding if past environmental change has generated com- mon responses in different WSV-restricted species both increases our knowledge about community assembly and evolution of this poorly studied habitat and indicates if, and how, future climate change may potentially affect these restricted species.
METHODS
SAMPLING AND MOLECULAR MARKERS.—We obtained blood and tis- sue samples of T. phoenicius (N = 95) and P. theresiae (N = 57) both through our own collection efforts and through loans from other institutions (Table S1), covering WSV patches in most Amazonian areas of endemism in Brazil (Fig. 1). Most sampling localities were common to both species and to Xenopipo atronitens (Capurucho et al. 2013). To better understand distribution and habitat preferences of the study species, we gathered locality data from online databases and museum records and generated a map including georeferenced records for the two species over the cur- rent distribution of open habitats within Amazonia (Fig. S1).
We obtained sequences of the mitochondrial gene for the NADH dehydrogenase, subunit 2 (ND2) and of the intron 15 of the gene for Aconitase 1 (ACO1) for both species. Additionally, we obtained sequences of the intron 7 of the gene for Beta Fib- rinogen (Fib7) for a subsample of four P. theresiae individuals. We also obtained sequences from the other two species in the genus Polytmus: P. guainumbi (one sample, ND2 and Fib7) and P. milleri (five samples, ND2 and Fib7). ND2 sequences of the most clo- sely related species to T. phoenicius were obtained from GenBank.
SEQUENCE DATA AND DATA MATRICES.—We extracted DNA using a DNA Purification Kit (Wizard", Promega). The primers used for ND2 amplification were: L5215 (Hackett 1996), H6313 (Soren- son et al. 1999), ND2-int-Tpho (CTATCCTTTCAGCA GCCCTA, this study), ND2-int-Pthe (CCACCTTACTCACCAC AAAG, this study); and for ACO1 amplification: Ai15fb (CCCGTGCTAACTACCTAGCCTC, Jeff Groth personal comm.) and Ai15ra (CCCAGGAATAACATACTGACG, Jeff Groth personal comm.). PCR products were purified using poly- ethylene glycol, and sequencing reactions were performed using the BigDye terminator kit v.3.1 (Applied Biosystems). Sequencing reaction products were precipitated with EDTA/Ethanol and sequenced in an ABI 3130xl sequencer (Applied Biosystems).
We edited DNA sequences and aligned them in the software Geneious 6.1.4 (Biomatters). For the nuclear markers, we used software PHASE 2.1.1 (Stephens et al. 2001) to reconstruct the sequences of the two alleles in heterozygotes. We assembled sequence matrices for each marker/taxon (a total of five matrices:

ND2, ACO, and Fib7 for P. theresiae; and ND2 and ACO for T. phoenicius). As the ACO intron is located in the sex chromo- some Z, the males have two copies of this region (ZZ) while females have only one copy (ZW). Accordingly, we included in the matrices only one sequence for each female sampled and two sequences for each male. The phi test was applied to evaluate the existence of recombination in the nuclear markers using the Split- sTree4.10 software (Huson & Bryant 2006).
PHYLOGENETIC ANALYSES, MOLECULAR DATING, AND HAPLOTYPE NETWORKS.—We performed phylogenetic analyses including one representative of each ND2 haplotype of P. theresiae and T. phoeni- cius plus outgroups selected based on recent molecular phyloge- netic reconstructions including the genera Polytmus (McGuire et al. 2014) and Tachyphonus (Burns et al. 2014). For Polytmus we included all three species of the genus plus Chrysolampis mosquitus as the out- group (McGuire et al. 2014), and for Tachyphonus we included T. coronatus and T. rufus as outgroups (Burns et al. 2014). These analyses aimed to confirm phylogenetic relationships and check for the existence of intraspecific lineages within P. theresiae and T. phoenicius. For these analyses we used a Bayesian approach in MrBayes 3.2 (Ronquist et al. 2012), running the analysis for 80 mil- lion generations. A burn-in of 8 million generations was adopted and posterior probabilities were calculated on the maximum clade credibility tree for each genus. For each dataset, jModeltest (Dar- riba et al. 2012) was used to choose the best evolutionary model according to the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC).
To obtain a time frame for the origin and evolution of the WSV taxa, we adopted a species tree approach to estimate the age of the split between each of our study species and its sister group, as well as for the main split detected within T. phoenicius (see Results), again using jModeltest (Darriba et al. 2012) and BIC. For
the Polytmus species tree analysis, we included all three species of the genus, C. mosquitus as outgroup and used sequences of ND2, ACO and Fib7 for all individuals. For T. phoenicius we included T. rufus and T. coronatus as outgroups and used sequences of ND2 and ACO for all individuals. Species trees were reconstructed in starBEAST (Heled & Drummond 2010), included in the BEAST 1.8.1 package (Drummond & Rambaut 2007), using a strict clock approach with an evolutionary rate of 2.1 percent divergence per million years (0.0105) fixed for ND2 (Weir & Schluter 2008). The evolutionary rate was estimated for the nuclear markers. The spe- cies tree prior used was a Yule process, with a piecewise linear and constant root population size model. The analysis was run for 50 million generations, a burn-in of 5 million generations was applied, and the log file was inspected in Tracer for convergence of the likelihood values and to check if effective sample sizes (ESS) of at least 200 were reached for all parameters.
We constructed haplotype networks using statistical parsi- mony in the software TCS 1.21 (Clement et al. 2000) for the markers ND2 and ACO, for both species. We used Mantel tests to assess the relationships between genetic and geographic dis- tance matrices for P. theresiae and, based on the detection of two distinct clades in T. phoenicius (see Results), for T. phoenicius South and T. phoenicius North. We used software Alleles in Space (Miller 2005) and run five different analyses: P. theresiae-ND2, P. theresiae- ACO, T. phoenicius-ND2-South, T. phoenicius-ND2-North, T. phoenicius-ACO. For each analysis we used two matrices, one including the DNA sequences, and the other including the geo- graphic coordinates for each individual.
HISTORICAL DEMOGRAPHY.—To test for evidence of past variation in population sizes, we used Tajima’s D (Tajima 1989), Fu’s Fs test (Fu 1997), and R2 (Ramos-Onsins & Rozas 2002), with

significance being assessed based on 10,000 coalescent simula- tions (assuming neutrality and equilibrium) in DNAsp 5.10 (Librado & Rozas 2009). We reconstructed the demographic history of populations using Extended Bayesian Skyline Plots (EBSP) in BEAST 1.8.1 (Heled & Drummond 2010) employing the two markers (ND2 and ACO) simultaneously and using a strict clock with an evolutionary rate of 2.1 percent per million years (Weir & Schluter 2008) fixed for ND2 and an estimated rate for ACO. Evolutionary models employed in this analysis were also selected using jModeltest and BIC. We ran analyses for 80 million generations, and inspected the log files in Tracer 1.5, with a burn-in of 8 million generations.
DIVERGENCE TIMES AND MIGRATION.—We obtained estimates of divergence time within T. phoenicius under an isolation-with-migra- tion model (Nielsen & Wakeley 2001, Hey & Nielsen 2004), implemented by IMa2 (Hey 2010). Although the program can handle data and implement a model for multiple populations, we performed the analysis for each population pair independently. This procedure was adopted because models involving more than two populations are more complex requiring a large amount of information. We performed the analysis for populations north and south of the Amazon River and, within the southern lineage, for populations east and west of the Madeira River. For each pair of populations, we obtained effective population size for current populations (h0 and h1) and the ancestral one (h2). We estimated migration rates in both directions (m1 > 0 and m0 > 1). To define the priors, we performed initial runs followed by three posterior runs for each population pair using distinct seed values, to verify the convergence of parameter estimates. Final analysis of northern versus southern populations consisted of 40 chains (geometric heating scheme set ha = 0.975 and hb = 0.75) and between southern populations (separated by Madeira River) con- sisted of 20 chains (geometric heating scheme set ha = 0.96 and hb = 0.9). For all analysis we applied a burn-in of 2 9 106 steps, followed by 30 9 106 steps. A total of 500,000 genealogies, from all runs were used to calculate the joint posterior probability of the parameters in L-Mode. We assumed a divergence rate of 2.1 percent per million years for ND2 gene (Weir & Schluter 2008) and for ACO we used 0.5 percent, based on estimates obtained in the starBeast analysis. For all IMa2 runs the evolutionary model used was HKY85 (Hasegawa et al. 1985).
RESULTS
We obtained ND2 (1012 bp) and ACO1 intron 15 (601 bp for T. phoenicius and 612 bp for P. theresiae) sequences for all T. phoenicius (95) and P. theresiae (57) samples. In addition, we obtained ND2 (1041 bp) and Fib7 (961 bp) sequences for five P. milleri samples (Table S1). We obtained ND2 sequences for T. rufus, T. coronatus and ND2 and Fib7 sequences for P. guainumbi from Genbank (Table S1).
POLYTMUS THERESIAE: NO GENETIC STRUCTURE AND RECENT POPULATION EXPANSION.—The phylogenetic analysis recovered the same relationships found by McGuire et al. (2014), with P. theresiae
sister to P. milleri, from the Tepuis, and P. guainumbi sister to this clade. All relationships had high support (posterior probability of 1, data not shown). The species tree analysis revealed that the divergence event between P. guainumbi and the clade (P. milleri, P. theresiae) occurred at about 5.84 million years ago (Ma, CI 5.05– 6.17). The split between P. milleri and P. theresiae dated to about 2.69 Ma (CI 2.20–3.38) (Fig. 2A).
Among the 57 P. theresiae individuals there were 12 ND2 haplotypes and 7 ACO haplotypes. Nucleotide diversity was very low for both markers (ND2: 0.05%; ACO: 0.17%) (Table 1). The ND2 haplotype network (Fig. 3A) shows one most common haplotype with several less frequent haplotypes connected to it by one single mutational step, in a star shape suggestive of popula- tion expansion. The ACO haplotype network shows two most common haplotypes (Fig. 3B).
All three neutrality tests (Tajima’s D, Fu’s FS and R2) indi- cated that ND2 evolution deviates from neutrality (Table 1), with negative values for Tajima’s D and Fu’s FS), suggesting recent population expansion, which agrees with the star-shaped ND2 haplotype network. In contrast, when applying the three tests to the ACO sequence data there was no deviation from neutrality, indicating no signal of historical changes in population size. EBSP analyses employing the two markers together revealed a strong signal of recent population expansion starting at about 50,000 yr ago (50 ka) (Fig. 4A). Mantel tests indicated no signifi- cant correlation between geographic and genetic distance matri- ces, suggesting that genetic diversity is not explained by geographic distance for either of the two markers.
TACHYPHONUS PHOENICIUS: DISTINCT LINEAGES WITHIN AMAZONIA.—Phylogenetic analyses recovered the same relation- ships among species found by Burns et al. (2014) and revealed two distinct and well supported clades within T. phoenicius, corre- sponding to individuals collected north and south of the Amazon River, respectively. All relationships had high support (posterior probability of 1, data not shown). For the species tree analysis we considered northern and southern samples of T. phoenicius as belonging to different taxa, so that four taxa were defined in the starBEAST analysis: T. phoenicius South, T. phoenicius North, T. ru- fus, and T. coronatus (Fig. 2B). Molecular dating analysis estimated that T. phoenicius split from the T. rufus/T. coronatus clade at about 11.70 Ma (CI 6.89–18.4), and that T. phoenicius Northern and Southern lineages were isolated at about 0.35 Ma (CI 0.14–1.15).
Among the 95 T. phoenicius individuals there were 35 ND2 haplotypes and 22 ACO haplotypes (Table 1). Nucleotide diver- sity was higher for both markers when compared to P. theresiae (ND2: 1.2% and ACO: 0.31%). The analysis of ND2 sequences revealed two divergent groups of haplotypes, with networks that are not even connected by the statistical parsimony method (Fig. 3C and D), in agreement with the results of the phyloge- netic analysis. The southern lineage had more haplotypes (23) and higher nucleotide diversity (0.37%) than the northern lineage (12 haplotypes and nucleotide diversity of 0.21%) (Table 1). The ACO haplotype network groups all sampled individuals in the same network, but it is possible to see an initial segregation

southern lineages separately. Deviations from neutrality were found for the ACO dataset by the Tajima’s D and Fu’s Fs tests and for the southern ND2 clade by all three tests (Table 1). There was no signal of deviation from neutrality for northern ND2 sequences (Table 1). These results indicate different demo- graphic scenarios in northern and southern populations of T. phoenicius, with signs of population expansion in the southern population. EBSP analysis employing both markers together, in contrast, finds a signal of population expansion for both northern and southern populations, with a stronger signal and more recent expansion in the northern than in the southern population (Fig. 4B and C). Mantel tests indicated significant correlation between geographic and genetic distance matrices only for the ND2 sequences of the southern population (r = 0.17), suggesting that genetic diversity is partly explained by geographic distance in this region.
The date of divergence between northern and southern lin- eages within T. phoenicius found by the IMa2 coalescent recon- structions is about 0.92 Ma, with higher migration rates from south to north (Table 2). When dating this same divergence event using starBEAST, we got a much more recent date (0.35 Ma). This difference is probably related to the fact that starBEAST

originated by dispersal from the WSV. The Tepuis are sandstone formations and some authors have called attention to a similarity between the herbaceous vegetation at the top of the Tepuis and WSV habitats in the lowlands (Huber 1988). Xenopipo atronitens, a WSV specialist, separated from its Tepuian sister species, X. uni- formis, during the Miocene (Capurucho et al. 2013). Miocene splits between lowland and Tepuian taxa are also documented for plants (Givnish et al. 2000) and frogs (Salerno et al. 2012), leading Capurucho et al. (2013) to suggest a common historical cause for these splits. Polytmus theresiae, on the other hand, split from its Tepuian sister species much more recently (2.69 Ma, 95% HPD: 2.20–3.38). This date coincides with the beginning of the Pleis- tocene and the onset of the glacial cycles. As the only remaining species in the genus, P. guainumbi, occurs in open areas outside Amazonia, it is not possible to know where the ancestral taxon to P. theresiae and P. milleri occurred, but if environmental changes associated with Quaternary glacial cycles promoted the expansion of WSV in northern Amazonia (see below), this could have caused an expansion in the distribution of P. theresiae’s ancestor, and contributed to the origin of this WSV species.
Tachyphonus phoenicius is an older lineage (11.70 Ma, 95% HPD: 6.89–18.40), suggesting a long history of the WSV habitat, in agreement with the similar but slightly younger age of the X. atronitens lineage (8.21 Ma, 95% HPD: 6.23–10.44). Despite the old age, the diversification that gave rise to the northern and southern lineages within both X. atronitens and T. phoenicius is recent (around 1 Ma). In contrast, terra firme forest taxa that diversified during the same period of time (since mid-Miocene) have accumulated much more genetic diversity, often giving rise to several allopatric species, with strong genetic structure throughout Amazonia (Ribas et al. 2012, d’Horta et al. 2013, Sousa-Neves et al. 2013, Fernandes et al. 2014, Thom & Aleixo 2015). It is possible that the history of WSV habitats contributed to this current pattern of low genetic diversity, with little WSV habitat available until recently or with historical oscillations in habitat availability leading to population botttlenecks.
Both species included in the sister clade of T. phoenicius, (T. rufus and T. coronatus), occur in open or edge habitats, mostly outside of Amazonia. The distribution of these two species is similar to that of P. guainumbi. Other WSV specialists, as X. atron- itens (Capurucho et al. 2013) and Elaenia ruficeps (Rheindt et al. 2008) also have non-Amazonian sister species (X. uniformis, from

does not consider migration, and thus the model considers shared ACO haplotypes between north and south of the Amazon River to ancestral polymorphism instead of gene flow. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that when running IMa analy- sis setting migration to zero, we got a divergence date between north and south similar to the one found by starBEAST (0.35 Ma, data not shown). In the comparisons between popula- tions from opposite margins of the Madeira River the divergence date was much more recent (around 80 ka) (Table 2), with a higher migration rate from west to east (Table 2).
DISCUSSION
ORIGIN AND BIOGEOGRAPHIC RELATIONSHIPS OF WSV AVIFAUNA.— The relationship between WSV and Tepuian avifauna has been noted before by Oren (1981), who suggested that Tepui species

the tepuis and E. cristata, from the cerrado, respectively). This pattern of sister relationships of WSV taxa to groups that do not occur in the adjacent terra firme forests suggests that the evolu- tionary transition from humid forest to a more open and dry habitat is more difficult than the colonization by non-Amazonian lineages already adapted to open habitats.
SAMPLING AND TAXONOMY.—Despite having a good geographic sampling within Amazonia, our analysis did not include the northern and western extremes of both species’ distributions. The main sampling gap is the Napo area of endemism. According to Alvarez Alonso and Whitney (2003), western WSV avifauna is a result of colonization from the east, especially from the Guiana shield region. Recent paleoclimatic reconstructions indicate that the Napo area of endemism was the area least affected by Pleis- tocene climatic oscillations (Cheng et al. 2013) and it remains to be understood how WSV birds reached the small WSV patches in the region, and if they are more connected to southwestern populations (our Guajara and Boca do Acre localities) or to northwestern populations (our Jau and Araca localities).
Although T. phoenicius presents two distinct clades that argu- ably represent two full species, no trustworthy taxonomic conclu- sions may be drawn at this moment. The type locality of the species is uncertain and currently designated as eastern Peru. Fur- thermore, in his doctoral dissertation, David Oren (1981) described three new subspecies of T. phoenicius based on plumage characters. Although our sampling includes the range of all recog- nized subspecies, the application of these names—if they are in fact deemed available—would depend on a thorough analysis of plumage in the genetically sampled specimens. Results of these analyses, currently underway, will be presented elsewhere when completed.
Polytmus theresiae has only one subspecies (P. t. leucorrhous), described for northwestern Brazil, Peru, and Colombia, and future sampling of this proposed taxon will help understanding if there is any geographical isolation within P. theresiae, in contrast to the lack of structure that we have found so far.
BLACKWATER FLOODED FORESTS AND WSV AVIFAUNA.—As found by Capurucho et al. (2013) for X. atronitens, T. phoenicius popula- tions from west of the Negro River also share haplotypes with populations from the eastern margin, corroborating that the blackwater flooded forests may be a less restrictive barrier for various WSV species than the terra firme forest and the white water flooded forests. Borges et al. (2016) suggest forests season- ally flooded by black water rivers represent an important habitat for WSV birds, probably because of the similarity in vegetation structure between blackwater-flooded forest and WSV (Oren 1981). Moreover, many WSV areas developed by leaching and podsolization of Quaternary sandy deposits (eolian and fluvial) as a consequence of wet climates, poorly drained terrains, porous quartizic soils and black acidic waters (Van der Hammen & Absy 1994, Latrubesse & Franzinelli 2005). It is also possible that the sampled WSV patches west of the middle Negro River (Jau) have been recently occupied, indicating a recent origin of the sandy
deposits that sustain patches of WSV in this region, or a greater sensitivity of these habitats to climate change, with recurrent local extinctions and recolonization.
CONTRASTING PATTERNS OF INTRASPECIFIC GENETIC DIVERSITY: POPULATION EXPANSION AND GENE FLOW.—Polytmus theresiae has lower diversity and structure when compared to T. phoenicius. This difference is more pronounced in the mtDNA marker. The his- tory of P. theresiae is characterized by a recent population expan- sion probably following extreme reduction in population size. Nucleotide diversity is greater for the nuclear marker than for the mtDNA marker, indicating a recent differential loss of diver- sity. Because the effective population size of a nuclear marker is larger than that of a mtDNA marker, it should lose less diversity in a bottleneck, which would explain the larger ACO diversity found within P. theresiae. The signal of recent population expan- sion revealed by the summary statistics (for ND2 only) and by the EBSP analysis (both markers) probably reflects recovery from this bottleneck. The lower genetic diversity and less structure found within P. theresiae may also indicate that this species was absent from southern Amazonia until recently or that its south- ern populations went extinct during the recent dry periods of the last glacial.
The history of the northern lineage within T. phoenicius holds some similarities to that of P. theresiae, with relatively low nucleo- tide diversity when compared to the southern lineage and a strong signal of recent population expansion revealed by the EBSP analysis. Also, both datasets (P. theresiae and northern T. phoenicius) indicate population expansion during similar periods of time, over the last 50 ka. In contrast the southern T. phoenicius lineage shows a signal of an older (~200 ka) population expan- sion. The southern T. phoenicius lineage has greater genetic diver- sity, a small but significant pattern of isolation by distance, and shows phylogeographic structure between eastern and western populations across the Madeira River. These results indicate a more stable range for this lineage through time. A similar pattern was described for X. atronitens, with signal of population expan- sion in northern populations and stability in southern populations (Capurucho et al. 2013).
Tachyphonus phoenicius and P. theresiae have different ages and biogeographical affinities, and occupy the WSV and adjacent habitats in different ways. Although both are listed as ‘near- restricted’ to WSV (Borges et al. 2015), both our own observa- tions and our mapping of specimen locality data (Fig. S1) indicate that P. theresiae is more commonly recorded in alternative habitats (blackwater flooded forest and savanna). We do not know, how- ever, how P. theresiae uses these alternative habitats, and it is para- doxical that this species has lower genetic diversity, because effective use of these alternative habitats should buffer the spe- cies from deteriorating climatic conditions during glacial periods. On the other hand, a broader habitat tolerance should make it easier for this species to disperse, and thus expand its distribution throughout Amazonia. The fact that both species and X. atron- itens include lineages that have gone through recent population expansion in similar periods of time suggest that, despite their

different histories, the three species responded similarly to recent landscape changes in Amazonia.
WSV AVIFAUNA AND LANDSCAPE HISTORY.—Several past climate reconstructions suggest that the middle and late pleniglacial per- iod (ca 65 to ~14 ka) was at a regional scale climatically character- ized by strong precipitation seasonality, with longer dry seasons and shorter, but very intense, rainy seasons (Latrubesse 2003, Latrubesse & Franzinelli 2005). Rivers had lower discharges, and the dunes in the Rio Negro basin and Roraima were active (Latrubesse & Nelson 2000, Carneiro-Filho et al. 2002, Latru- besse et al. 2005). The vegetation cover of northwestern Amazo- nia structurally resembled dry forests (ca 65–24 ka), with a peak of drier conditions between ~24–14 ka, (D’Apolito et al. 2013). During the Lateglacial (14–10 ka, Younger Dryas) more arid than current conditions seem to persist in several north-central Ama- zonian localities (Carneiro-Filho et al. 2002, Latrubesse & Franzi- nelli 2005, D’Apolito et al. 2013), with wetter conditions and forest recovery becoming more pronounced only in the middle Holocene, and current environmental conditions being reached only after 6 ka (D’Apolito et al. 2013). Changes in forest struc- ture during the last glacial maximum (LGM) are also suggested by modeling of Amazonian vegetation cover (Cowling et al. 2001) and of paleoenvironmental conditions (Cook & Vizy 2006).
A consequence of the more seasonal and colder climate would be a less dense vegetation cover, which, combined with lower river discharges, would facilitate river channel migration. Increased seasonality and river migration have been hypothesized to represent an important mechanism for the origin of white- sand patches both in southern Amazonia and in the Negro basin, in locations where megafans developed during this period (Latru- besse 2002, Zani et al. 2012, Rosseti et al., 2012).
The paleoenvironmental scenario described above has important implications for WSV evolution because it would: (1) cause an increase in available sandy deposits and genesis of new or larger white-sand patches; (2) cause changes in the permeabil- ity of the forest matrix to the WSV avifauna; and (3) make the white-sand soils even more inhospitable during glacial maxima, considering that sandy soils have less capacity of retaining water and thus may suffer more from seasonal drought. Our results corroborate the ones obtained for X. atronitens (Capurucho et al. 2013) and are consistent with this scenario, with low diversity, weak genetic structure, and signs of population expansion in WSV taxa, especially in northern populations. Relatively greater phylogeographic structure and diversity of southern populations suggests lower connectivity and higher environmental stability or older WSV patches in this region.
In summary, current patterns of genetic diversity in all WSV bird species studies so far indicate low structure, low diversity, and recent demographic expansion in northern populations. These pat- terns are in sharp contrast to those of Amazonian terra firme forest birds, which have strong phylogeographic structure among inter- fluvia and higher diversity (Ribas et al. 2012, d’Horta et al. 2013, Sousa-Neves et al. 2013, Fernandes et al. 2014, Thom & Aleixo 2015). Considering that current WSV distribution is patchy, that
there seems to be current restrictions to gene flow among isolated WSV bird populations (Capurucho et al. 2013), and that a high proportion of Amazonian white-sand areas, including most areas sampled in this study, have developed on fluvial or eolian deposits of Pleistocene or even Holocene age (Carneiro-Filho et al. 2002, Rossetti et al. 2014), the combined evidence indicates expansion of white-sand soils along the Quaternary, and periods of higher con- nectivity among WSV patches in the recent past. This evidence argues against a static Amazonian landscape throughout the Qua- ternary, as also suggested by a large set of paleogeographic evi- dence (Latrubesse & Ramonell 1994, Van der Hammen & Absy 1994, Latrubesse & Rancy 1998, Mayle et al. 2004, D’Apolito et al. 2013, Cohen et al. 2014). If current Amazonian landscape devel- oped relatively recently, as suggested by these and several other results, current phylogeographic patterns may have originated in response to a past landscape that has recently changed, and recon- structing the history of this landscape is key to understand current diversity patterns and their future trends.
