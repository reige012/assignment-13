The split decisions in Tuesday’s primaries make it clear that the nominating contests in both parties could last for months.

FROM OUR ADVERTISERS


The outcome brought Donald Trump a significant step closer to the Republican nomination. Should that happen, the general election between him and the Democratic nominee could present Americans with the starkest difference in campaigning in modern presidential history. Mr. Trump took up ever more alarming tactics this week. With more protesters turning up at his rallies, he has been asking attendees to raise their right hands and swear allegiance to him. He’s begun seeding crowds with plainclothes officers to sniff out dissenters, tightened efforts to corral reporters, and dances dangerously close to inciting violence against protesters.

On the Democratic side, Hillary Clinton’s surprising loss in Michigan is still being analyzed, but it holds some lessons about how to approach future contests.

Mrs. Clinton’s candidacy speaks eloquently of embracing the people, values and thinking that make this nation a leader in the world. But her campaign tactics, particularly in Michigan, did not live up to this vision.

Even with a double-digit lead before the primary, she failed to avoid the type of negative tactics that could damage her in the long haul. A new Washington Post-ABC poll says that nationally, Mrs. Clinton’s margin over Bernie Sanders has shrunk: she polls at 49 percent compared with 42 percent for Mr. Sanders; in January her lead was more than double that. If she hopes to unify Democrats as the nominee, trying to tarnish Mr. Sanders as she did in Michigan this week is not the way to go.

Mrs. Clinton’s falsely parsing Mr. Sanders’s Senate vote on a 2008 recession-related bailout bill as abandoning the auto industry rescue hurt her credibility. As soon as she uttered it in Sunday’s debate, the Democratic strategist David Axelrod registered his dismay, tweeting that the Senate vote wasn’t explicitly a vote about saving the auto industry. Even as reporters challenged her claim, she doubled down in ads across the state. As The Washington Post noted, “it seems like she’s willing to take the gamble that fact-checkers may call her out for her tactic Sunday — but that voters won’t.”

Though Mrs. Clinton spent more time in Genesee County, home to Flint, than Mr. Sanders, she only won narrowly there. Mr. Sanders’s full-throated call for top-to-bottom government accountability for Flint’s drinking-water catastrophe contrasted with Mrs. Clinton’s tepid remarks about the need for a housecleaning at the Obama administration’s Environmental Protection Agency.

Mr. Sanders’s opposition to free-trade agreements resonated in Michigan, and are likely to help him in Ohio, Missouri and Illinois next week. He has consistently pointed out Mrs. Clinton’s past support for trade pacts, starting with Nafta when her husband was in the White House, and her shifting positions ever since. Mrs. Clinton is now opposed to the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which she promoted as secretary of state. If she hopes to convince skeptical rust-belt voters that she’s in their corner, she needs to explain why she once believed that trade pacts would help American workers.

The Clinton machine should stop trying to tie Mr. Sanders to the National Rifle Association. Though Mr. Sanders has a D-minus from the N.R.A., in Michigan Mrs. Clinton’s operatives took to Twitter touting the N.R.A.’s tweets supporting Mr. Sanders’s statement that making manufacturers liable for gun violence would destroy gun manufacturing in America. On Tuesday, her campaign issued a news release saying that the mothers of Trayvon Martin and Jordan Davis, two African-American shooting victims, “are speaking out about Senator Bernie Sanders’ comments on guns and African-Americans in Sunday’s Democratic primary debate.” Mr. Sanders, like Mrs. Clinton, has spent decades working against racial discrimination, poverty and gun violence. To suggest otherwise is wrong.

Mrs. Clinton may be annoyed at the continued challenge posed by the self-described democratic socialist from Vermont. “The sooner I could become your nominee, the more I could begin to turn our attention to the Republicans,” she told a crowd in Detroit. But Mr. Sanders is likely to remain in the contest to the end, and if she is the Democratic nominee, Mrs. Clinton must win over and energize his supporters. The results in Michigan suggest she has a ways to go.

Democratic Debate: Live Updates
Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders face off in a debate for the second time this week. Tonight it’s in South Florida, just days ahead of the state’s primary. Here’s how to watch.
Nick Confessore, Maggie Haberman and Alan Rappeport are providing real-time analysis. Keep up with the 2016 race with our newsletter.

Clinton says meeting with dissidents is important. "I think both Castros have to be considered authoritarian and dictatorial, because they are not chosen by the people," she says.

Back and talking Cuba. Would they meet with Cuban dissidents? Castro?

And he gets in a line about the "disastrous" trade policies of the 1990s.

Sanders takes the meatball Clinton served over the plate about him criticizing Bush, which was sort of a hard line to swallow.

Like the last debate, Clinton is defending the 1990s. She says Sanders is too sympathetic to George W. Bush and too hard on her husband and Obama.

I'm also a bit surprised that a fracking ban is the evening's biggest applause line.
Maggie Haberman
10:34 PM et Invalid Date
Nick, that's about right.

Clinton offers somewhat more modest goals, in many respects, with a lot of details about how to get there. Sanders offers somewhat more ambitious goals, with very little detail about how to get there.
Alan Rappeport
10:32 PM et Invalid Date
Sanders just issued a bold challenge to Clinton, asking her to join in a proposal to ban fracking.
Nicholas Confessore

For better or for worse, there is a clear distinction between the candidates.

Well, tonight Sanders did the interrupting, and he got the same slapdown that he gave Clinton a few nights ago.

Now Clinton and Sanders are shouting over each other.

"We need a political revolution in this country," Sanders says when asked about solving climate change. It is his answer to most questions when pressed on how he would get legislation passed.

Sanders is making the argument right now that Obamacare is not so hot.

"I do believe in universal coverage," Clinton says. "I fought for it 25 years ago."

"My dad used to say, if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is," Clinton says of Sanders's plans.
Maggie Haberman
10:24 PM et Invalid Date
This gets to the crux of Clinton's argument against Sanders for months, that he can't accomplish what he promises.
Alan Rappeport

"Thanks for copying a very good idea," Sanders says to Clinton.

Clinton says her plan is to let students refinance their student debt.
Alan Rappeport

"I don't think they will, but Donald Trump's kids can go to public school right now," Sanders says. "We're going to get to Donald Trump by raising the taxes on the top 1 percent and on millionaires and billionaires."
Alan Rappeport

Ramos does not seem to understand how the Sanders free public college plan works. Sanders explains and says students should not be punished with loads of student debt.
Maggie Haberman
10:18 PM et Invalid Date
Clinton just got cut off with bells a few times. Sanders asks, "Can I have a little bit of time here, please?" and gets it.
Alan Rappeport
10:18 PM et Invalid Date
"It's a huge question," Sanders says. "YUGE, I know."
Maggie Haberman
10:18 PM et Invalid Date
Clinton seems annoyed and it's not surprising. A lot of these questions are more suited to an interview, and the moderators keep pulling the two apart when they're actually debating substance.

"Everything I just said will improve the living conditions of Latinos," a frustrated Clinton says when pressed for specifics.
Maggie Haberman
10:17 PM et Invalid Date
And Nick, to your point about the minority position among American voters, I actually am not sure about that. It's a minority opinion in the Republican primary, but I don't know that it's the same in national polling.
Maggie Haberman
10:17 PM et Invalid Date
Nick, I don't think that's even a close call.

Gonna make a call here, which will undoubtedly tick off some partisans of Sanders: At the 1:15 mark, Clinton is being questioned significantly more sharply than Sanders.
Alan Rappeport
10:14 PM et Invalid Date
Sanders says the big difference is that he stands up to special interests and does not take corporate money. "The point is, look at the record, and it is a record that I am proud of."

And we're back. A question for Sanders on the difference between being a career politician and an establishment politician.

Ramos did a good job pinning them down on it. Clinton or Sanders will have little wiggle room on that against Trump or Cruz (or Kasich or Rubio).
Nicholas Confessore

Maggie, I suspect it is a minority position among American voters, perhaps even among Democratic voters.
Maggie Haberman

Comprehensive immigration reform has been a major factor in the dwindling political fortunes of Senator Marco Rubio, who aggressively supported that measure in 2013.
Maggie Haberman
10:11 PM et Invalid Date
I saw a tweet from Ben Smith at BuzzFeed that I think was dead on -- the entire middle at this debate has evaporated.
Maggie Haberman
10:10 PM et Invalid Date
Yes, Nick, it is really striking, the chasm between the views on both sides of the spectrum.
Nicholas Confessore
10:10 PM et Invalid Date
That is the position of many immigration activists -- and certainly of Jorge Ramos, one of the moderators.
Nicholas Confessore
10:10 PM et Invalid Date
I reread the transcript. What you saw was the Democratic candidates closing in on -- thought not quite going to -- the position that it is immoral to deport anyone who came here illegally who is not a criminal.
Nicholas Confessore
10:07 PM et Invalid Date
While we're on break, Maggie and Alan, I want to turn back to that debate exchange.
Maggie Haberman

So folks at home could be forgiven for having some whiplash.
Maggie Haberman

In the parallel universe that is the Republican primary, the front-runner for the nomination said in an interview that aired before this debate that "Islam hates us" and insisted that steaks he put out for display at his victory night rally really were Trump steaks, even though the label said Bush Bros.
